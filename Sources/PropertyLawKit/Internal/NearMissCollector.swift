/// `snapshot()` once the backend returns. The kit packages the snapshot
/// into `CheckResult.nearMisses`, preserving the §4.6 contract that
/// `nil` means "this law/backend doesn't track near-misses" while `[]`
/// means "tracked but found none".

/// Backed by `NSLock` rather than Swift 6's `Mutex` because the package
/// supports macOS 14 and `Mutex` requires macOS 15 / Synchronization. The
/// sync work under lock is constant-time (one append, or one array copy).
