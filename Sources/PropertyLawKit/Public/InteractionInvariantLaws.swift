/// v2.4.0 — runtime harness that drives an `InteractionInvariant`

/// SwiftInferProperties v2.0 M9's RefactorBridge proposes
/// invariant conformers; this harness is what the conformer needs
/// to run those proposals on CI (via the macro discovery
/// integration on the SwiftInferProperties side, queued as a
/// separate cycle).
///
/// **One Strict-tier law per call** —
/// `invariantHoldsAfterEachStep` — `Invariant.invariantHolds(in:)`
/// must hold against the initial state AND after every action in
/// the sampled sequence. A violation reports the prefix of actions
/// that drove the state to the failing configuration.
///
/// **Why per-step, not just post-loop.** The invariant is a
/// permanent property of the State (per PRD §5 / §9); a single
/// step that breaks it is the bug, even if a subsequent step
/// happens to repair it. Per-step checks catch transient
/// violations the post-loop check would miss.
///
/// **Generator caveat.** For `Action: CaseIterable`, this
/// convenience entry uses `Gen<Action>.case` (uniform). Domains
/// where some actions are far more / less common than others
/// should construct their own `Generator<Action, _>` via the
/// primary `ActionSequenceFactory.actionSequence(from:length:statefulGuards:)`
/// entry. Stateful guards filter at the sequence level (drop
/// candidate actions that wouldn't be allowed in the running
/// history) — pass them via `statefulGuards`.
