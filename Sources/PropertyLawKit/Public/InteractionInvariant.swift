/// v2.3.0 — root protocol for SwiftInferProperties v2.0's
/// **InteractionInvariantBridge** (PRD §9). Conformance declares a
/// state-level boolean predicate that an interaction-bearing reducer
/// is expected to preserve after every action it processes.
///
/// **The conformer is NOT the reducer.** Per PRD §9.2, the verify
/// harness takes the reducer as a closure parameter, so a single
/// invariant-bearing type doesn't need to *be* the reducer. Pattern:
/// the user writes a stub type that conforms to one of the five
/// family-specific sub-protocols (Cardinality / RefInt / etc.) and
/// implements `invariantHolds(in:)`; the harness drives the actual
/// reducer.
///
/// ## Conformance shape
///
/// ```swift
/// struct InboxCardinality: CardinalityInvariant {
///     static func invariantHolds(in state: Inbox.State) -> Bool {
///         (state.isShowingSheet ? 1 : 0)
///             + (state.isShowingAlert ? 1 : 0) <= 1
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// ## Why kit-defined
///
/// SwiftInferProperties' M9 RefactorBridge (v1's equivalent: M8 in
/// SwiftPropertyLaws v1.9) promotes ≥ 3 Strong-tier interaction
/// invariants on the same reducer into a Bridge proposal — the user
/// conforms a stub type to each family-specific sub-protocol, and
/// the kit's discovery plugin runs the predicate check on every CI
/// invocation thereafter. Pre-v2.3.0 the protocols didn't exist;
/// the Bridge had no kit-side surface to propose.
///
/// ## Sub-protocols
///
/// The five family sub-protocols are **mutually independent** — no
/// hierarchy. PRD §9.4 documents that ≥ 2 firing simultaneously on
/// the same reducer surface as peer proposals, not nested choices.
/// `ActionIdempotenceInvariant` carries an additional Action
/// associatedtype + idempotent-action set; the other four refine
/// without adding requirements.
