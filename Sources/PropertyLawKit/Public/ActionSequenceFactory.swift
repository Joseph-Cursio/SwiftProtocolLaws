/// lives in `PropertyLawCore` (the plan-only layer — produces
/// `DerivationStrategy` enum values, no runtime `Generator`) and the
/// PRD wording predated a closer look at the kit's actual architecture.
/// `Generator<...>` lives one layer up in `PropertyLawKit` (which
/// `@_exported import`s `swift-property-based`), so the runtime-Gen-
/// producing factory needs to live here. Keeps the
/// `PropertyLawCore` plan-vs-runtime layering intact.
///
/// **Two entries:**
///   - `actionSequence(from:length:statefulGuards:)` — primary,
///     carrier-agnostic. Caller supplies any `Generator<Action, _>`;
///     factory wraps it into an `Action`-array generator with
///     stateful-guard filtering.
///   - `actionSequence(forCaseIterable:length:statefulGuards:)` —
///     convenience for `Action: CaseIterable`. Internally builds the
///     per-action generator via PropertyBased's `Gen<Action>.case`
///     and delegates to the primary entry.
