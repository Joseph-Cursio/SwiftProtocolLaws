/// Pass 3 validation (PRD §8): retroactive investigation of a real
/// `swift-collections` commit, plus the empirical finding that closed it.
///
/// **What we set out to do.** Commit `swift-collections@35349601` ("Typo:
/// symmetric difference should be the xor, not intersection") fixed a
/// one-character bug in `_Bitmap.symmetricDifference` — `&` (intersection)
/// was changed to `^` (xor):
///
/// ```swift
/// // Pre-fix:
/// internal func symmetricDifference(_ other: Self) -> Self {
///     Self(_value: _value & other._value)   // & = intersection
/// }
/// // Post-fix:
/// internal func symmetricDifference(_ other: Self) -> Self {
///     Self(_value: _value ^ other._value)   // ^ = xor (correct)
/// }
/// ```
///
/// The plan: pin `swift-collections` to the buggy parent SHA `8e5e4a8f`
/// and demonstrate that `checkSetAlgebraProtocolLaws(TreeSet<Int>.self, ...)`
/// retroactively catches the violation through the four `symmetricDifference*`
/// laws added to PRD §4.3 SetAlgebra in response to this finding.
///
/// **What we actually found.** At the buggy SHA, `TreeSet.symmetricDifference`
/// returns the *correct* answer for every input — including Apple's own
/// regression test inputs. Tracing through the source: `_Bitmap.symmetricDifference`
/// is defined but **never called** from the public path. `TreeSet.symmetricDifference`
/// dispatches to `_HashNode.symmetricDifference` → `_HashNode._symmetricDifference`
/// → `_HashNode._symmetricDifference_slow*`, which builds the result
/// element-by-element via the structural traversal in
/// `_HashNode+Structural symmetricDifference.swift`. None of those call
/// `_Bitmap.symmetricDifference`. The buggy method is dead code at the
/// pinned SHA — Apple's "regression test" guards against future code that
/// might begin using `_Bitmap.symmetricDifference`, not against an
/// observable user-facing bug.
///
/// This test target therefore asserts the *empirical truth*: `TreeSet`
/// passes every kit law at the buggy SHA, including all four
/// `symmetricDifference*` laws — because no public API exercises the
/// buggy code. The kit's checks are *not* false-positive: they faithfully
/// reflect the public semantics, even when the source contains visible
/// (but unreachable) bugs.
///
/// **Implication for PRD §8.** The §8 1.0 gate ("catch a real semantic
/// conformance bug in 5+ popular packages before 1.0") is empirically
/// hard to close against well-maintained packages. The git-archaeology
/// pass that surfaced commit `35349601` searched four full-history
/// repos (~5,200 commits across `swift-argument-parser`,
/// `swift-aws-lambda-runtime`, `swift-collections`, `swift-nio`,
/// `hummingbird`); the only candidate that survived rejection was this
/// dead-code typo. See `Validation/FINDINGS.md` Pass 3 for the
/// rationale and the proposed §8 rewrite.
